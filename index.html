    <div class="item">My name is Jesse Pollack! I'm from South Florida and have just moved to Los Angeles to begin
        my coding adventure. My hobbies include outdoor activities such as hiking and running, as well as watching
        my favorite TV shows and movies. I'm a huge puzzle solver and will spend hours staring at a problem I'm struggling with 
        just so I can get the euphoria that comes with the solution, so coding is right up my alley!

             This includes working with other developers, 
                a group of people whose personalities I thoroughly enjoy(I love how methodical we are!). When I took my share of 
                programming classes in college, we had plenty of fairly demanding group projects that taught us the importance of delegation, 
                constructive criticism, and open communication. Despite the difficulty of many of these assignments, I relished in the intellectual thrill
                of solving puzzles with my fellow peers, and I wouldn't trade our late nights in the study room of planning, coding, and debugging for the world! I wholeheartedly look forward to 
                making these team-bonding experiences my full-time career.

            Here are links to some of my Github projects! While I don't have too many projects up as of yet, I do have the website I 
            worked on for the pre-course. Fortunately, I've come a long way in just the two days that I have been a part of Thinkful,
             and have learned how to add interactive elements to my website and make my website dynamically respond to changes in screen
              dimensions! Click the screenshot to read the source code, as well as to check out my Github(or click on the Github logo in 
              the contact section)!

            The services I intend to provide largely reside in the backend realm of programming. While I love designing the visual 
            aspect of a website, my real passion lies in the long and arduous study of algorithms, formulas, and object-oriented and 
            functional programming. I love working with Java and, from what I've learned so far, Javascript. I hope to absorb as many 
            backend languages as I can in the duration of this course. I also intend to work on a JavaFX game as a pet project while 
            I'm working through the course material.
